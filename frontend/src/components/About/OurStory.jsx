            The Upper Room Sanctuary began with a vision for revival and restoration. What started as a small group gathering in a living room has grown into a thriving, Spirit-led community committed to worship, discipleship, and outreach.
            <br /><br />
            Founded on prayer and fueled by the Holy Spirit, the church has become a beacon of hope in the city. Our journey is marked by miracles, transformed lives, and a deep hunger for Godâ€™s presence. Every gathering is an opportunity to encounter Jesus and walk in purpose.
